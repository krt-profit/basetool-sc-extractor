All spike code lives in `spike-phase0/harness/` (branch `spike/refinery-phase0`);
private inputs/outputs stay under the gitignored `spike-phase0/work/`.

## 1. Golden test set (deliverable 4)

12 images from the owner's example set, transcribed triple-blind (three independent
readers, zero disputes), stored as `work/golden/<id>.json`:

| Group | Images | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Auftrag 1 | 4 × 4K frames | quoted order, duplicate materials, **scrolled viewport** (same header, different rows) |
| Auftrag 2 | 4 × 4K frames | **un-quoted GET-QUOTE state** (3 frames), the quote transition (1 frame), **HUD-marker overlap**, second PROCESSING panel beside the SETUP panel |
| Auftrag 3/4/6 | 3 pre-cropped panels | pre-cropped input path, `(ORE)` suffixes, REFINE-OFF rows, `IN MANIFEST ≠ TO REFINE` (a4) |
| Auftrag 5 | 1 × 4K frame | game-UI-truncated name (`CONSTRUCTION S`), large quantities (55 100) |

A "cell" for scoring = 6 order-level fields + 5 columns × every non-partial golden row;
exact match after normalization (`harness/score.py`: numeric folding `48928.00 == 48928`,
case/whitespace/bracket folding for names, `null == "--"` for absent values — the
terminal renders absent cost/time/yield as `--`).

**Coverage gaps (owner action, plan §Phase 0 Inputs):** native 1080p / 1440p / ultrawide
captures still need to be collected; the current set is 4K + pre-cropped only.
*(Partially superseded: since 2026-06-12 the golden set is 10 orders / 19 images
including native ultrawide — see the addendum "Golden set, current composition".)*

## 2. Model bake-off (deliverable 1)

All 7 models × 2 strategies × 12 images (scorer of 2026-06-10, after the `null == "--"`
fix); raw outputs under `work/bakeoff/<model>/<strategy>/`:

| Model | schema | markdown | sec/image (GPU) | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen3-vl:8b-instruct` (q4_K_M) | 0.9821 | **0.9872** | 4.2–4.4 | **winner / default pin** |
| `qwen3-vl:8b-instruct-q8_0` | 0.9796 | 0.9872 | 4.3–7.3 | no gain over q4; not needed |
| `qwen3-vl:4b-instruct` | 0.9209 | 0.9872 | 3.1–4.3 | **low-VRAM/CPU fallback** |
| `gemma4:12b` | 0.9235 | 0.8852 | 22–29 | behind, slow |
| `glm-ocr` (0.9B) | 0.8929 | 0.0714 | 3.8–6.0 | viable only schema-forced; beaten by 4b |
| `qwen3.5:9b` | 0.5357 | 0.4872 | ~43 | unusable (5 parse failures) |
| `gemma4:e4b-it-qat` | 0.2755 | 0.3699 | 7.5–10.4 | unusable |

Decisive tie-breaker among the three 0.9872 results: **which errors survive the
production mitigations (§6)**. The 8b variants' errors are all absorbed (HUD overlay →
numeric validation; name garble/trailing dot → fuzzy matching; method → enum
nearest-match; `? AUEC` → numeric validation). The 4b's two REFINE-toggle misreads
(OFF→ON, a4) are the **only error class with no validation net** — they also corrupt the
`SUM_MISMATCH` checksum. Hence: **default `qwen3-vl:8b-instruct` q4_K_M; fallback
`qwen3-vl:4b-instruct`** (documented weakness: REFINE toggles on small/distant panels).

The documented qwen-vl table-repetition-loop bug never appeared in either quantization
(0 parse failures, 0 extra rows across 48 runs) — q8_0 is not needed as a mitigation.
`glm-ocr`'s markdown failure is expected: the OCR specialist does not follow the layout
instruction; with schema-forcing it is decent but strictly dominated by the 4b. Identical
accuracy across the re-timed q4 runs confirms temp-0 determinism end-to-end.

### 2.1 Error taxonomy (primary model, every remaining mismatch)

| Class | Instances | Production mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| HUD overlay read into a cell (`2.1KM` as yield) | 1 (both strategies) | numeric plausibility validation → review flag (§6) |
| Name spacing/garble (`SA VRIL IUM`, `SAVRILIMUM`) | 2 | absorbed by backend fuzzy matching (Phase 1, threshold 0.84) |
| Method "autocorrect" (`DINYX SOLVATION`) | 1 (both strategies) | nearest-match against the closed refining-method enum |
| Truncation artifact (`CONSTRUCTION S.` trailing dot) | 1 | fuzzy matching absorbs; or strip trailing punctuation |
| REFINE toggle misread (OFF → ON) | 2, **schema strategy only** | strategy choice (markdown); review UI shows toggles |

The schema strategy's two extra semantic errors (REFINE toggle) are consistent with the
"Format Tax" hypothesis (plan deliverable 2): schema-forcing during the vision pass
degrades visual judgment. Markdown + deterministic reformat wins on both accuracy and
error severity.

## 3. Locate → Normalize → Read (deliverable 3)

`harness/normalize.py`. **Locate** is classical CV on a 1/4-scale frame using two color
anchors — pure luminance profiling fails (the whole terminal interior is uniformly dark,
measured mean 35–64):

1. the maroon SETUP tab strip (~RGB(72,49,45); gap-tolerant runs, width-similarity
   clustering, strip height ≤ 12 rows at 1/4 scale), and
2. a bright-orange CTA/progress element below it (absolute run threshold — small/distant
   panels have small buttons).

The maroon strip covers only the panel's **left** part (the "WORK ORDER n" zone right of
it is dark gray, measured); the panel's right edge = max(strip end, CTA end) + margin.
Do **not** scan the whole body for orange — with two panels side by side that bleeds into
the neighbour's progress bar (verified regression during the spike).

**Multi-candidate + owner rule (2026-06-10):** a frame can hold several work-order panels
side by side (Auftrag 2: SETUP next to a running PROCESSING panel). The **newest order is
always the leftmost panel, and the leftmost is the extraction target** — candidates are
returned left→right and the pipeline takes `boxes[0]`. The VLM read's `panelType` is a
*validation* only (warn if not SETUP), never a selection mechanism.

Pre-cropped inputs (width < 1000 px and portrait) skip Locate. Fallback when no candidate
is found: the verified 4K geometry `(950, 350, 920, 1500)` scaled by frame size.

**Normalize** always runs client-side (Ollama silently downscales > ~3.2 MP): crop from
the native frame, resize to long edge 1536 px (pre-cropped capped at 1200 — upscaling a
~500 px panel beyond ~2.4× only blurs), dimensions snapped to multiples of 32.

**Location read** (terminal header strip, separate region `(250, 200, 900, 220)` @4K,
2× upscale): **9/9 exact matches** (`LEVSKI`), ~2.5 s/image, 3 output tokens.

## 4. Prompt + read strategy (deliverable 2)

Prompt v1 is externalized at `harness/prompts/setup_panel_v1.txt` (temperature 0,
`num_predict` 4096 with one retry at 8192 on `done_reason=length`, numeric cells read as
strings, parsed in code). One amendment shipped during the spike: the positive `quoted`
rule ("quoted is TRUE when the YIELD column shows numbers and the bottom button reads
CONFIRM; FALSE only when YIELD shows `--`") after a smoke-test miss.

**FROZEN: strategy (b) — freeform markdown read + deterministic reformat**
(`harness/read.py: read_markdown` + `_parse_markdown`). It beats schema-forcing on every
qwen-vl variant (0.9872 vs 0.9821/0.9796/0.9209) and avoids the schema strategy's
semantic-class errors (REFINE toggle) — the "Format Tax" confirmed on our domain. The
deterministic markdown→JSON parser is ~40 lines and fully unit-testable. Prompt v1 +
`MARKDOWN_INSTRUCTION` are the frozen artifacts Phase 3 ships as resources.

Note: the prompt asks the model to ignore overlapping AR markers, but the `2.1KM` case
(§2.1) shows prompt-hardening alone does not stop overlay bleed-through — the
**validation rule** (§6) is the reliable defence.

## 5. Hardware tiers (deliverable 5)

Measured on RTX 5090 32 GB / Ryzen 9 9950X3D (16C/32T); loaded sizes from the
vendor-neutral `ollama ps` probe (recorded per model under
`work/bakeoff/*_ollama_ps.txt`), **at Ollama's default 32k context**:

| Model | Loaded (GPU) | GPU sec/image | CPU-only sec/image (100% CPU probe) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `qwen3-vl:8b-instruct` q4_K_M | 10 GB | 4.2–4.4 | ~53 |
| `qwen3-vl:8b-instruct-q8_0` | 13 GB | 4.3–7.3 | not measured (not pinned) |
| `qwen3-vl:4b-instruct` | 7.9 GB | 3.1–4.3 | ~27 |
| `glm-ocr` | 4.0 GB | 3.8–6.0 | ~21 |

- **Tier table (preflight UI, `DESIGN_SC_EXTRACTOR.md` §5.1):** recommended = ≥12 GB
  VRAM → default 8b (10 GB loaded); minimum = ≥8 GB VRAM → 4b fallback (7.9 GB);
  below that → CPU mode with a "~1 minute per screenshot" warning (53 s on a top-tier
  16-core; weaker CPUs proportionally slower — surface the measured first-image time).
- **Phase-3 knob:** the loaded sizes include the default 32k context; our prompt + one
  image need a fraction of that. Shrinking `num_ctx` (e.g. 8k) cuts the KV-cache share
  and gives 12 GB cards real headroom for the 8b — measure once in Phase 3 and pin it.
- CPU mode is fully functional (accuracy identical — same model, same weights; verified
  36/36 on the probe image for both qwen variants).
- The auto-select policy stands: probe VRAM → pick 8b / 4b / CPU + warn; "close Star
  Citizen before extracting" stays (the game holds VRAM).

## 6. Confidence-derivation policy (deliverable 6) — **two-pass rejected**

The planned policy (exact-match agreement across two reads with varied crop) was
validated against the golden set (`harness/twopass.py`) and **fails on the data**:

| Pass-2 perturbation | Real errors caught | False flags (new pass-2 errors) |
|---|---|---|
| pad 24, scale 0.9 | **0 / 5** | 2 (digit flips `6811→6011`, `404→484`) |
| pad 40, scale 1.0 | **0 / 5** | 2 (digit flips `404→494`, `1802→1902`) |

All real errors are *systematic* — the model reads the same wrong value at every crop
(temp 0), so crop perturbation can never expose them; meanwhile the perturbed pass
*introduces* ~2 digit errors per 12 images and doubles latency.

**Frozen policy instead — deterministic validation, no second pass:**

1. **Numeric plausibility:** QTY / YIELD / header totals / cost must parse as a number or
   `--`; anything else (e.g. `2.1KM` HUD bleed-through) → row review flag. Catches error
   class 1.
2. **Closed-enum nearest-match** for the refining method (and `panelType`). Catches
   class 3.
3. **Backend fuzzy-match score** (Phase 1, threshold 0.84) is the per-row name
   confidence; classes 2/4 sit above the threshold and surface as match-with-score.
4. **Header-total checksum** per §7 (one-sided — see below).
5. Verbalized VLM self-confidence stays **forbidden** (uncalibrated for OCR, plan §9.5).

The §5.4 UI thresholds are unchanged; they are fed from (1)–(4).

## 7. Header-total semantics (deliverable 7) — verified

From the golden set (fully visible panels a3 / a5 / a6, plus a4's visible rows):

- **`TO REFINE` = Σ QTY of REFINE-ON rows**, within ±1 per panel (displayed integers are
  rounded from fractional internals): a3 1160≈1161, a5 55100=55100, a6 2826≈2827,
  a4 1947≈1948.
- **`IN MANIFEST` ≥ `TO REFINE`**; on a3/a5/a6 the OFF rows contribute 0 and
  `IM == TR`. On a4 (`2564` vs `1948`) the two small OFF rows (37+578=615≈616=IM−TR)
  are counted while the large OFF row is not — hypothesis: toggle state changed after
  quoting. IM's exact rule is **not** reliably reconstructible from one frame; do not
  validate against it.
- **The materials list is a scrolling ~6-row viewport** (Auftrag 1/2: identical header
  totals, different visible rows across frames). Σ of visible rows can therefore never
  equal the header on long orders — a hard equality check is impossible by design.

**Frozen `SUM_MISMATCH` rule (one-sided):** flag WARNING ("a scrolled screenshot may be
missing rows") when `Σ QTY(visible REFINE-ON rows) > toRefine + rowCount` (the +rowCount
absorbs ±1 rounding per row), or when any single row QTY exceeds `toRefine + 1`.
Equality is **not** required; a shortfall means scrolled-out rows, which the §5.4 review
UI surfaces via the row count.

## 8. Domain rules confirmed by the owner during the spike

- **Leftmost panel = newest order = extraction target** (2026-06-10, see §3).
- Real screenshots are **private** (player handle + account balance) — never committed;
  fixtures are synthesized/redacted.

## 9. Blueprint-parser regression (Definition of Done)

`.\gradlew.bat test --rerun` green on `spike/refinery-phase0` (2026-06-10) — the spike
touches no production parser code. The manual 179/`greluc` characterization check against
the private `game-log/` remains a manual step before merging Phase 3.

## 10. Open items

1. **Owner:** collect native 16:9 1080p / 1440p captures (§1) — tracked as a Phase 3
   risk; the Locate stage is resolution-agnostic by construction but unverified below
   4K except via downscaling. Ultrawide is covered since 2026-06-12: Auftrag 8/9 add
   native 5120×1440 captures, live-validated in the golden-set sweeps (addendum).
2. ~~Phase 3: measure and pin a reduced `num_ctx` (§5) and re-verify the 12 GB tier.~~
   **Done 2026-06-12** — pinned to 12288 in `HttpOllamaClient`; see the addendum.

Everything else (model pins, strategy/prompt freeze, hardware tiers, confidence policy,
header semantics, golden set, parser regression) is **done** — see the sections above.

## Addendum 2026-06-12 — REFINE correction from the YIELD column (Auftrag 10)

A field capture (Auftrag 10, two pre-cropped 4K panels) showed the REFINE misread class
on the pinned **8b** too, not just the 4b (§2): two refine-OFF rows (BEXALITE 597,
LARANITE 510) read as `ON` at full confidence. Root cause is visual, not strategic: the
toggle renders an **orange knob in BOTH states** — left = OFF, right = ON — so prompt
v1's cue ("filled/orange = ON, empty/gray = OFF") cannot discriminate.

Fix follows the §4 principle (validation rules, not prompt-hardening, are the reliable
defence) and extends the §6 policy with a deterministic rule: **in a quoted order the
YIELD column is the authoritative refine signal** — the terminal quotes a yield for
exactly the refine-ON rows and renders `--` for OFF rows (yield 0 stays ambiguous:
INERT MATERIALS shows 0 while OFF, so 0 falls back to the toggle read). A contradicting
toggle read is corrected at confidence 0.85 plus an order-level `REFINE_CORRECTED`
warning. Un-quoted orders carry no yield signal; there the toggle read still stands.

**Prompt v1 amendment 2 (2026-06-12):** the toggle cue is re-worded to knob POSITION
(right = ON, left = OFF; both states show an orange knob, fill never decides) plus the
yield correlation as a secondary hint — same amendment mechanism as the §4 `quoted`
rule. Smoke test (8b, temp 0, raw Auftrag 10 captures): capture 1 reads both OFF rows
correctly with the amended cue (was 0/2 before); capture 2 still reads its LARANITE
instance as ON — the amendment reduces but does NOT eliminate the misread class, so the
validation-layer correction above stays the authoritative defence for quoted orders.
The amendment mainly protects UN-quoted orders (no yield signal there); the golden-set
re-validation is the sweep below.

**Golden-set re-validation (2026-06-12, live 8b via the `PromptSmokeTest` harness —
env-gated on `PROMPT_SMOKE_DIR`, a no-op in CI):** the 10 sample-order folders
(`Beispiele Raffinerieaufträge`, private captures) ARE the Phase 0 golden set; the full
sweep surfaced and fixed two follow-up issues. (1) The yield-based refine correction
must gate on the ROW's surviving read having seen the quoted state, not on the
order-level `quoted` flag — Auftrag 2 mixes three pre-GET-QUOTE captures with one
quoted capture, and rows visible only in the early captures show `--` legitimately
(`StitchedRow.quotedRead` carries the provenance). (2) The model transcribes the
material suffix inconsistently as `(ORE)`/`[ORE]` across reads of the same panel; the
stitcher's row-identity key now folds the bracket style (exported names stay verbatim).
Result: orders 1/3/4/5/6/7 read clean (checksums consistent, no warnings); orders 8/9
have their misread ON toggles corrected by the yield rule with checksum-exact ON sums
(407≈408, 1316≈1317); order 10 corrects three toggle misreads and `SUM_MISMATCH`
correctly flags its remaining QTY digit misread (403→483); order 2 flags
`SUM_MISMATCH` over a residual digit misread — review-flow material, as designed.

Same capture, same root-cause family: a QTY digit misread (`403` → `483`) — caught by
the §7 checksum once the two corrected OFF rows no longer inflate Σ QTY(ON).

**Golden set, current composition (2026-06-12 — supersedes the 12-image set in §1):**
10 order folders, 19 images. New since §1: Auftrag 7–10, which add native **ultrawide
5120×1440 JPEG** captures (closing that part of the §1/§10 coverage gap) and the
REFINE-OFF/digit-misread cases that drove this addendum series.

| Group | Images | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| Auftrag 1 | 4 × 4K frames | quoted order, duplicate materials, **scrolled viewport** (same header, different rows) |
| Auftrag 2 | 4 × 4K frames | **un-quoted GET-QUOTE state** (3 frames) + the quote transition (1 frame), **HUD-marker overlap**, residual QTY digit misread (494→404, verify-corrected) |
| Auftrag 3/4/6/7 | 4 pre-cropped panels (~480–520 px wide) | pre-cropped input path, small-glyph reads, `(ORE)` suffixes, REFINE-OFF rows, `IN MANIFEST ≠ TO REFINE` (a4) |
| Auftrag 5 | 1 × 4K frame | game-UI-truncated name (`CONSTRUCTION S`), large quantities (55 100) |
| Auftrag 8/9 | 2 + 2 × **ultrawide 5120×1440 JPEGs** | native ultrawide aspect + JPEG compression; REFINE toggle misreads corrected by the yield rule; a9 = largest row set (11 rows) |
| Auftrag 10 | 2 pre-cropped panels (~910–970 px wide) | the **orange-knob REFINE-OFF class on the pinned 8b**, the `403`→`483` digit misread (checksum/verify case) |

Scoring stays per §1 (cell = order fields + 5 columns × non-partial row, normalized
exact match); re-validation runs live through the `PromptSmokeTest` harness rather than
the spike scorer. Still missing per §10: native 16:9 1080p / 1440p captures.

## Addendum 2026-06-12 — read-time fixes for the residual error classes: experiments

Both residual classes (REFINE toggles on UN-quoted orders; digit misreads) were probed
for read-time fixes against the golden set. Results, so nobody re-runs these:

**Digit misreads are NOT fixable at read time — three negatives.** The Auftrag 10 case
(`403` read as `483`; ground truth re-verified: the TO REFINE header pixels are an
unambiguous `1645`, and Σ QTY(ON) with 403 lands exactly on 1644≈1645):
1. `qwen3-vl:8b-instruct-q8_0` (higher weight precision) reads `483` too — not a
   quantization artefact. Auftrag 2's residual digit error also survives q8 unchanged.
2. Upscaling the pre-cropped panel to the full 1536 px (instead of the 1200 cap) reads
   `483` too — not an input-resolution artefact.
3. A focused, 4×-zoomed QTY-column strip read STILL reads `483` — the glyph pixels are
   genuinely ambiguous (the terminal's chromatic aberration turns the `0` 8-shaped).
   The information that it is 403 exists only in the header-checksum arithmetic.
   `SUM_MISMATCH` + review remains the correct and only defence. (A basetool-side
   yield-ratio plausibility check could narrow review further — it owns the refinery
   yield data; the extractor must not hardcode game-balance constants.)
4. Post-hoc chromatic-aberration removal does NOT help either. The actual R/B channel
   misalignment vs G is only ~±0.25–0.4 px (measured by glyph-masked NCC registration;
   full-area registration is biased to zero because SC applies film grain AFTER the CA,
   channel-correlated). Re-aligning the channels still reads `483`; dropping to the
   green channel alone reads `483` AND introduces a new digit error (105 → 165 — R+B
   carry real SNR for the white digits). The fringes are the visible symptom, but the
   damage (subpixel smear + grain + TAA on 2-px glyph strokes) is baked in at capture
   time and not invertible. The only effective lever is at the source: the images step
   now tells the user to set chromatic aberration to 0 in the game before capturing.

**One new deterministic rule shipped:** `YIELD > QTY` is physically impossible
(refining removes impurities) ⇒ guaranteed digit misread in one of the two cells; the
row drops to [implausible] like a non-numeric cell. Catches a subclass row-precisely.

**REFINE toggle strip re-read: prototyped, validated, REJECTED.** A cropped, zoomed
read of just the toggle column (third read region, analogous to the location read) was
prototyped for un-quoted panels. On the full golden set (19 images): 8 images fully
correct (including both Auftrag 10 captures the panel read got wrong), 8 degenerate
answers safely caught by a row-count gate — but **2 images (Auftrag 3/4, small
pre-crops) returned a count-matching list with 1–2 WRONG states**, i.e. the strip read
would inject toggle errors the panel read had right. Same failure pattern that
rejected two-pass agreement in §6: a second read that errs itself is no defence. NOT
shipped; un-quoted orders keep the §5.3 `UNQUOTED_ORDER` re-capture advice as designed.

## Addendum 2026-06-12 — model bake-off round 2 + cross-model verify (shipped)

**Candidate sweep** (live golden set, identical prompt/pipeline/`num_ctx`): no installed
or newly available Ollama vision model beats the pinned `qwen3-vl:8b-instruct` as the
primary. `q8_0` reads the same digit errors (not a quantization issue); `gemma4:12b`
breaks stitching with digit noise at ~40 s/image; `gemma4:e4b`, `glm-ocr`,
`deepseek-ocr`, `minicpm-v4.6` are structurally unusable on this panel;
`qwen3.5:9b` (thinking) needs ~66 s/image and loses 7/10 orders; `ministral-3:8b` is
mid-field; `minicpm-v4.5` LOOKS clean (and reads the famous `403` correctly!) but
silently DROPS and duplicates rows (81 vs 86 across the set; A9: 5 of 11 rows) and
flips toggles at full confidence — its clean checksums are shortfall artefacts. The
8b pin stands.

**Cross-model verify (shipped, `CrossModelVerify`):** §6 rejected two-pass agreement
with the SAME model (temp-0 errors are systematic — both passes read the same wrong
value). Two DIFFERENT vision encoders, however, err decorrelated: on the golden set
8b × 4b disagree on 8 of 430 cells and there is NO cell where both read the same wrong
value — the union of both error sets becomes visible. Mechanism (after stitching, one
model switch per run): rows pair 1:1 (count mismatch ⇒ conservative order-level
`VERIFY_MISMATCH` only); cosmetic name variants fold; a disagreeing QTY on a refine-ON
row is ARBITRATED by the TO-REFINE checksum (exactly one candidate lands the Σ inside
±rowCount ⇒ it wins, `VERIFY_CORRECTED`, confidence 0.85); everything else undecidable
is contested (confidence 0.75, `VERIFY_MISMATCH`). Live result: the two open digit
misreads (A2 494→404, A10 483→403) are now AUTO-CORRECTED — both former
`SUM_MISMATCH` orders validate cleanly — and the previously silent errors (A1 quality,
A9 quality+qty) are flagged row-precisely. Zero false corrections; +~1.5 s/image.

**Partner pin: `Preflight.MODEL_VERIFY = qwen3-vl:4b-instruct`** — it aligns row sets
on 8/10 orders (10/10 since prompt amendment 3 + garble-tolerant stitching, see the
follow-up addendum) and reads both critical digits correctly; `minicpm-v4.5` also reads
them but misaligns row sets on most orders (verify degrades to "not comparable").
Policy: verify runs on the RECOMMENDED tier (GPU) only and only when the partner is
already installed — an accuracy bonus, never an extra download or a below-tier
slowdown. Harness: `PROMPT_SMOKE_VERIFY_MODEL` re-runs this validation.

## Addendum 2026-06-12 — `num_ctx` measured and pinned (§10 item 2 closed)

Measured on the RTX 5090 box with a worst-case read image (full-frame 4K capture →
panel crop → 1536 px long edge, the normalize ceiling): the read needs **~2018 prompt
tokens** (text + vision) and **~250 output tokens** — Ollama's 32k default context was
almost pure KV-cache waste. Loaded sizes from `/api/ps` per `num_ctx`:

| `num_ctx` | 8b loaded | 4b loaded |
|---|---|---|
| default (32k) | 9.51 GB | 7.37 GB |
| 16384 | 7.23 GB | — |
| **12288 (pinned)** | **6.66 GB** | **4.51 GB** |
| 8192 | 6.09 GB | — |

**Pinned: `num_ctx = 12288`** (`HttpOllamaClient.NUM_CTX`) — the smallest size that
still holds prompt (~2k) plus the FULL retry output budget (`num_predict` 8192 on a
`length` stop) with margin; 8192 would silently cap the retry. Accuracy verified: the
golden-set sweep with the pin is value-identical to the unpinned sweep (only the known
nondeterministic `(ORE)`/`[ORE]` bracket artefact differs, which the stitcher key
folds). Tier outcome: the 8b now loads at ~6.7 GB (real headroom on 12 GB cards, as §5
hoped) and the 4b at ~4.5 GB (comfortable on the 8 GB minimum tier). Tier thresholds
(12/8 GB cards) stay unchanged.

## Addendum 2026-06-12 — prompt amendment 3 + garble-tolerant stitching: verify 10/10

Follow-up question after round 2: would adapted prompts or a different `num_ctx`
improve the candidates or the verify combination? Findings:

**`num_ctx` is not a lever — for ANY model.** Across all round-2 sweeps the Ollama
server log shows zero input truncation (`truncated = 0` on every read; largest input
~3.0k tokens against the 12288 pin). The only two `truncated = 1` events are runaway
GENERATIONS (6 995 output tokens) from already-disqualified candidates hitting the
retry budget — a symptom of their degenerate answers, not a cause. Raising `num_ctx`
cannot change any candidate's reading; the 12288 pin stands for both pinned models.

**Prompt amendment 3 (PARTIAL is a suffix, never a row).** The 4b's only structural
defect as verify partner was a literal ghost row `| PARTIAL | ? | … |` on A7/A8 — it
misread the edge-cut marker instruction as a row of its own (its 6/12 real rows were
value-identical to the 8b's!). The prompt's last line now spells out "PARTIAL is a
name suffix, NEVER a row of its own" (with an example), and — §4 principle: a prompt
fix is never the only defence — `MarkdownPanelParser` additionally drops any row whose
material name is exactly `PARTIAL` (no real material carries that name). Result: the
4b's row sets align with the 8b's on A7/A8; the 8b's own golden-set reads are
value-identical under the amended prompt (no primary regression).

**Garble-tolerant row identity (stitcher + verify).** A repeat combo sweep surfaced a
run-to-run flake: the 4b once transcribed `LINDINIMUM` for `LINDINIUM` (A1), which
broke the scroll-overlap detection → 5 duplicated rows → verify degraded to "not
comparable" on a previously clean order. Row identity in the stitcher and the verify
name comparison now tolerate a Levenshtein-1 name garble IFF quality AND qty are both
present and exactly equal — duplicate materials always differ in their numbers, so the
numbers disambiguate; exported names stay verbatim (basetool fuzzy-matches names
downstream, §2). This also protects the PRIMARY path against the same flake class.

**Result (live, full golden set + verify, 61 s):** verify coverage is now **10/10
orders comparable** (was 8/10): A2/A10 stay auto-corrected (`VERIFY_CORRECTED`), A1's
silent quality error and A9's silent quality+qty errors are contested row-precisely,
A3–A8 clean, zero false corrections.

**Adapted prompts do NOT rescue the rejected candidates.** `minicpm-v4.5` re-swept
under the amended prompt still reads structurally wrong row sets (A8: 4 of 12 rows;
A9: 8 of 11; extra ghost/duplicate rows on A2/A10) — the row-loss pathology is not
prompt-addressable. The other rejects fail structurally (answer format, speed, digit
noise), not on prompt wording; per-model prompt forks would add maintenance surface
for no measured gain. The single shared prompt and both model pins stand.

## Addendum 2026-06-12 — pipeline review round: new deterministic rules + plumbing

A full pass over the pipeline (architecture, algorithms, prompts) shipped the following;
golden-set sweep after the changes is value-identical to the pre-change state (10/10
verify coverage, A2/A10 corrected, zero new flags):

**`IN MANIFEST` is NOT checksummable — measured negative.** The hope was a second
checksum (Σ of ALL rows) that would arbitrate QTY disagreements on refine-OFF rows
(the A9 case). Measured across the golden set: on a1/a2/a3/a5/a6/a7 the header simply
equals `TO REFINE`; on a4/a8/a9/a10 it diverges with no relation derivable from the
visible rows (a1's visible row sum 37 736 even EXCEEDS its 32 295) — no rule ships,
OFF-row disagreements stay contested-only.

**New deterministic rules (all golden-set re-validated):**
1. *Physics arbitration in the verify merge* — refining removes impurities, so
   `YIELD ≤ QTY` always holds. When the models disagree on ONE of the two cells while
   agreeing on the other and exactly one candidate satisfies the bound, it wins
   (`VERIFY_CORRECTED`); reaches cells the header checksum cannot (OFF rows, missing
   header).
2. *Quoted-read-wins stitching* — the overlap fold now prefers the row variant whose
   READ saw the quoted state (not just "has a numeric yield"): an OFF row shows `--`
   in the quoted capture too, and the un-quoted variant surviving meant the yield-based
   refine correction was blind on exactly those rows in mixed capture sets.
3. *CTA cross-check* — the transcribed bottom button is a redundant read of the quote
   state; `CONFIRM`/`GET QUOTE` contradicting `quoted` flags `CTA_MISMATCH`.

**Plumbing:** the conditional per-call `keep_alive 0` release protocol is gone — every
read pins 10m and the pipeline issues explicit best-effort `unload` calls (primary
before the verify partner loads, the active model at run end), removing the bug-prone
conditional class. The verify pass surfaces as a per-image `VERIFY` stage in the §5.3
track. A silent Locate colour-anchor miss now logs a console warning, and the fixed
fallback geometry scales the panel SIZE by height only (the game renders the panel at
16:9 size on ultrawide). One transport-level retry on transient chat IO failures.
The smoke harness gained an env-gated golden-expected diff
(`PROMPT_SMOKE_EXPECTED`/`PROMPT_SMOKE_WRITE_EXPECTED`) so future prompt/model changes
fail loudly on regressions; the expected file holds private capture data and lives
next to the golden set, never in the repo.
