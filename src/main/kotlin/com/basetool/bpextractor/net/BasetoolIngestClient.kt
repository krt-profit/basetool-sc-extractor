/**
 * Sends the locally-produced export JSON to the basetool ingest gateway (epic
 * krt-profit/basetool#639, the `:ingest` module). The caller supplies the access token obtained via
 * the device grant; this client never authenticates.
 *
 * <p>TLS for the gateway terminates at the basetool's edge proxy (nginx-proxy-manager until
 * 2026-09-12, basetool ADR-0162) and it runs plain HTTP behind it, so the prod
 * base URL is a publicly-trusted {@code https://ingest.<domain>} (standard TLS — no custom trust)
 * and the only non-TLS escape is an explicit {@code http://localhost} / {@code http://127.0.0.1}
 * for the dev stack. There is **no** global trust-all and no self-signed handling. Mirrors
 * {@code UpdateChecker}'s HTTP discipline; surfaces the RFC 7807 {@code detail} (localized via the
 * relayed {@code Accept-Language}).
 *
 * <p>**The scheme follows the server (RFC 9449, `REQ-INGEST-012`).** A proof accompanies the request
 * exactly when Keycloak actually bound the token (`token_type: DPoP`), and the `Authorization` header
 * switches to the `DPoP` scheme with it. Presenting an *unbound* token under that scheme is a hard
 * `401` — Spring's `JwkThumbprintValidator` demands `cnf.jkt` — so the decision belongs to the
 * server's answer, never to this client's preference. The gateway accepts both schemes, so a client
 * rollout needs no flag day.
 *
 * <p>**Why this was once the opposite.** While the gateway *relayed* the access token to the backend,
 * a bound token could not survive the second hop: the proof binds to this client's key and, via
 * `htu`, to the gateway's URL, so the backend received a DPoP-issued token as a plain bearer and
 * refused it. That broke every blueprint send on 2026-08-03, surfacing as the backend's opaque "you
 * must sign in" three layers from the cause. The conclusion drawn then — never bind the access
 * token — treated the relay as fixed. ADR-0129 removed the relay instead: the gateway validates the
 * proof itself and calls the backend under its own service account, so the party that validates the
 * token is now the party that consumes it, which is the only arrangement in which
 * sender-constraining an access token pays at all.
 *
 * <p>DPoP therefore protects both credentials now: the access token on this hop, and the **refresh
 * token** that [DeviceGrantClient] binds at the token endpoint — the long-lived one this app
 * persists to disk, and the one most worth protecting.
